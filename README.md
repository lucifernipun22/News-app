# News App

## üìå Project Description
The **News App** is an offline-first Android application that provides users with the latest news articles. It ensures a seamless user experience by caching articles for offline access, supporting dark mode, and providing a clean, modular codebase for easy maintenance and scalability.

## üöÄ Features
- Offline-first architecture for accessing news without an internet connection.
- Dark mode support for better user experience.
- WebView integration to read full articles.
- Save articles for later reading.
- Bottom navigation for smooth navigation.
- Data persistence using Room Database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Kotlin** - Primary programming language.
- **MVVM Architecture** - For better code separation and maintainability.
- **Jetpack Components**:
  - ViewModel - To manage UI-related data.
  - LiveData - For observing changes in data.
  - Navigation Component - For handling navigation.
  - Room Database - For local data persistence.
  - DataStore - To store user preferences (e.g., dark mode settings).
- **Retrofit** - For API calls to fetch news data.
- **Coroutines & Flow** - For asynchronous programming.
- **Glide** - For image loading.
- **Material Components** - For UI enhancements.

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites:
- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
- Minimum SDK: 23
- Internet connection for fetching news

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/news-app.git
   cd news-app
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**:
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Open the cloned project.

3. **Sync Gradle**:
   - Wait for Gradle to sync dependencies.

4. **Run the app**:
   - Connect a device or use an emulator.
   - Click **Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è in Android Studio.

5. **API Configuration**:
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `NewsApiService.kt` with your API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

## üìö Libraries Used
| Library         | Purpose |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Retrofit** | For making API requests. |
| **Room** | For local data storage. |
| **DataStore** | To store user preferences (dark mode). |
| **ViewModel** | To manage UI-related data. |
| **LiveData** | To observe data changes. |
| **Navigation Component** | To handle navigation between fragments. |
| **Glide** | For loading and caching images efficiently. |
| **Coroutines** | For handling background operations. |
| **Material Components** | For enhanced UI design. |

## üîç Architecture & Design Choices
### **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
The app follows the **MVVM architecture** to ensure a clean separation of concerns:
- **Model**: Handles the data layer (Retrofit API calls, Room database, DataStore for settings).
- **View**: UI layer (Activities, Fragments displaying data to users).
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between View and Model, managing UI logic and LiveData.

### **Offline-First Approach**
- Uses **Room Database** to store news articles locally.
- Fetches new articles only when connected to the internet.

### **Dark Mode Implementation**
- Uses **DataStore** to save user preference.
- Automatically switches themes based on the stored preference.

## üéØ Future Enhancements
- Implement search functionality to find news by keywords.
- Add push notifications for breaking news.
- Enable multi-language support.
- Introduce user authentication for personalized recommendations.
